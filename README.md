Just playing around with Azure Storage Service SAS

Using the Azure Storage Python SDK, this performs the following actions:

1. Generates a SAS token for a specific directory and lists the contents

2. Generates a SAS token for a specific directory and using this token:
    a. Uploads a file containing random data to the same directory.
    b. Downloads the same file again.
    
3. Using the SAS token from the previous step:
    a. Uploads a file containing random data to the a different directory.  
    b. Downloads the same file again.
    
This demonstrates the validity of the tokens generated by the Python SDK for Service SAS at a directory level. (sr=d)

When the directory matches that which is specified in the SAS token the operation will be performed. ** STEP 2 **
WHen the directory is different the operation will fail.  ** STEP 3 **
